Give a wrong answer and you will lose a life.<br />4. Keep on going until the end of the game<br />The questions will get more and more difficult. Be careful, you only have three lives.

* exaclick uncovers a hidden picture/clip for the player. If the "stop"-button is clicked - time stops and a Moodle-quiz-question has to be answered. This question has to be configured at the beginning by the trainer with the Flash-editor in the "configure questions"-tab.<br /><br />ATTENTION: the game only accepts links to files that are accessible for students within Moodle, i.e. from within a course-folder. the picture/clip has to be uploaded before question-configuration.
* gamelabs.at - this Opensource online-adventure-creator enables you to create small adventures based upon any subject. Games that have been created (by a trainer or a student) can be embedded into Moodle here.';
