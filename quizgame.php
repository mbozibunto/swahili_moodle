Quizventure is an activity module that loads quiz questions from the course it\'s added to. The possible answers come down as space ships and you have to shoot the correct one.

**Note**: Quizventure is designed to promote learning rather than for assessment. Students will have infinite attempts with instant feedback. For this reason, only add questions you want students to learn the answer to, rather than questions you want to assess if they have learned';
